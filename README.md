Welcome to the Wuzlog
=====================

This is a super simple blog software written in Node.

If you'd like to remix it, just remove the files in the `posts/` directory and add your own. They will autopopulate on the index page, and be accessible at `/p/post-name`, where post name is the file name minus `.md`.

If you remix it, hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CallMeWuz) and let me know! I'd love to see what you make.

If you are looking for a good starting place on this project, check out the TODO.md file! If you implement something, let me know and I will include it in the project with attribution!
