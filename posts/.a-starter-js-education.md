The [state of Javascript](https://stateofjs.com/) is a hairy topic. It can seem new libraries, mindsets, frameworks, and "one true ways" are popping up all the time. The language itself is an odd mix of functional, object-oriented, and imperitive styles and a single app can be written at least 15 different ways. How does one navigate this rapidly shifting and tumultuous landscape? What things are worth learning? Where do you even start?

I've tried my best to answer these question for myself - and now I'd like to share my thoughts with you.

## Getting started - How to read these posts
